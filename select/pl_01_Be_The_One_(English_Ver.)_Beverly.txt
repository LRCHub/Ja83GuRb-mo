I walk alone,
it doesn't matter for how long
I'll keep going,
wherever these footprints
will lead me
I believe it's destiny
An endless road,
but I know that
you're strong and bold
Somewhere out there
waiting for me with
a smile that shines like gold
There you will
Be The One
(DA！)
Be The One All right！
I don't wanna give it up,
fighting for tomorrow
Be The Light
(DA！)
Be The Light All right！
Love is strong and
it'll always find a way
Reaching out your hand,
just take it closer
to your heart
Never lose the fire,
and hold on to what you believe
Be The One Be The Light
Message from my heart,
I'll send it to you
Be The One Be The One
Be The Light
There's nothing more
important than the life you hold
Just remember you've gotta
go and keep on moving forward
so you make the most of everyday
The strength you've built,
the kindness that you've
learned to grow
All together makes your soul
a better, brighter light, I know
There you will
Be The One
(DA！)
Be The One
We will keep on looking
for a way,
night will always turn to day
Be The Light
(DA！)

We will take our past and share
it with our future
Living in the moment,
everything's a miracle
Shining like the sun
and beaming like the moonlight
Be The One,
Be The Light
Message to my heart,
I won't let it go
la la la～
You will Be The One

into brightness yeah
Leading you into the light
